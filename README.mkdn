Welcome to OrionOS
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with OrionOS, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the OrionOS trees, use this command:


    repo init -u git://github.com/TeamOrion/platform_manifest.git -b mm6.0

If you want to download our Uber toolchains do:


    mkdir .repo/local_manifests && cp .repo/manifests/uber_manifest.xml .repo/local_manifests/


Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync
